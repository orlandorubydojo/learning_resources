# MiniTest

### What is MiniTest?
From [Seattle RB](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)

MiniTest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

Mini Test is comprised of the following:
- minitest/unit is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.
- minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/unit and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.
- minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!
- minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.
- minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too.
